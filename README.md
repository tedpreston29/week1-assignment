230pm: I have created a header with a nav bar and used flexbox to arrange these neatly, I'm struggling at the moment to remember which class selector goes with what html element and this can be time consuming for me...

Nav bar and background image implemented successfully. I had trouble with this at first but now that it is done I think I would be more confident doing it again moving forward.

03:55pm
Finally managed to implement all three images. I did have trouble with my last image (VS code said it was untracked). I believe the issue was because the orignal path of the image couldn't be found by ubuntu. also images are too big and are being cropped. Would be good to learn how to find images that dont crop or what resolution they should be

I am going to add content now to each of the pages with boxes for text to be written.

05:30pm

I added a footer, not sure if it is allowed to be within the main but it is the only way I could figure out how to overlay my last image section.

created a back to top button using. I found this fairly easy now that I have done the other nav buttons.
