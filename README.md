# week1-assignment

my goal in this assignment is to create a website page showing off future technologies.

230pm: I have created a header with a nav bar and used flexbox to arrange these neatly, I'm struggling at the moment to remember which class selector goes with what html element and this can be time consuming...

03:01pm
Nav bar and background image implemented successfully. I had trouble with this at first but now that it is done I think I would be more confident doing it again moving forward.
now onto my second image.

03:55pm
Finally managed to implement all three images. I did have trouble with my last image (VS code said it was untracked). I believe the issue was because the orignal path of the image couldnt be found by ubuntu.

I am going to add content now to each of the pages with boxes for text to be written.
